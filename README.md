# Web_Scrapping_timesjobs

This piece of Python code uses web scraping techniques to extract job listings from the TimesJobs website. 
It prompts the user to enter an unfamiliar skill and then retrieves and parses the HTML content of the job search page for "Data Scientist" positions. 
The code filters out jobs that require the specified unfamiliar skill and saves the details of matching jobs in separate text files. 
Each text file includes the company name, required skills, and job information. 
Finally, the code prints the index of each saved file to indicate the matching job listings.
